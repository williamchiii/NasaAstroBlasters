As a spin-off of the famous 1980s game "Space Invaders", our video game AstroBlasters is a rendition of the popular game shooting asteroids instead of aliens. In this game, the player controls a spaceship, navigating through space while avoiding or shooting down incoming asteroids. The objective is to survive as long as possible and score points by destroying asteroids. The simple nature of this game is meant for the astronauts to take their minds off of their situation while showing them that the rest of humanity admires their work. Since it resembles the late game "Space Invaders", AstroBlasters may remind astronauts of their youth: playing in arcades and being with friends. 
     This video game is meant to be played regardless of any wireless connection and on any device that has graphics enabled, allowing it to be compact and microgravity-friendly. It is important to remind astronauts of their lives back on Earth and the journey ahead to motivate them and reinforce their reason to explore space.
